This week we learned how to code script into unbuntu severs. We also learned about hhtp and javascript coding, and how it works. This week we also learned that you can get payed for coding if you code something usable you can get a hoddie and if 100 people use it then you get an echo dot. This week was the most important week becuase we learned mutiple things such as push, pull, and git commit in the ubuntu sever.
