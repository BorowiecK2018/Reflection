This week I have learned how to code new commands into the ubuntu sever such as push, pull and add. These commands are necessary in order to save your work on git hub. This week we also signed up for GitHub and how it works/ what it does. This topic of discussion was important because we will need git hub commands and GitHub for our future projects. I learned that coding can get you free merchandise like if you code an application that people use you get a free hoodie and if 100 people use and download it you will get an echo dot.
